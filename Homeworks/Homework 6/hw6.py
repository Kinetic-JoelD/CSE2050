Part 3: Conclusion

Based on your performance analysis, write a conclusion that addresses the following points:

1. Provide a ranking of the sorting algorithms based on their performance in each scenario. Which sorting algorithm performed best in each case (Random, Sorted, Reverse Order, Move End to Front, Move Front to End), and why do you think it performed better?

2. Explain how the number of swaps made by each algorithm affects both efficiency and time complexity across different scenarios.

3. Discuss the impact of the initial order of data on how well each algorithm performs. Explain why some algorithms perform differently on sorted, reversed, or random lists.

"""
1. 
Random: #1. Selection Sort #2. Insertion Sort #3. Bubble Sort
Sorted: #1. Bubble Sort #2. Insertion Sort #3. Selection Sort
Reverse: #1. Selection Sort #2. Insertion Sort #3. Bubble Sort
Move End to Front: #1. Bubble Sort #2. Selection Sort #3. Insertion Sort
Move Front to End: #1. Insertion Sort #2. Selection Sort #3. Bubble Sort

2. 

The number of swaps made by each algorithm has a direct effect on efficiency and time 
complexity because swapping is rearranging elements in a list. With selection sort it has a 
consistently the same number of swaps because it checks against each element in a list at least 
once except for the first element and this gives it a consistent running time of O(n^2). While 
insertion sort and bubble sort are adaptive and can have varying time complexities based on the 
list. 

3. 

For sorted data Bubble sort and insertion sort work well because the number of swaps they
have to do are none while selection goes through the entire list. 

For random data selection sort works the best because it is consistent with the number of swaps 
it has to do while insertion and bubble sort are up in the air

For move end to front bubble sort works the best because it's moving the max values to the end 
of  the list while insertion sort has to move through the sorted list a bunch of times to sort it, and 
selection sort is consistent again with its swaps and its time.

For move front to end insertion sort works the best because it doesnâ€™t have to move as much 
stuff around in the sorted list it has while bubble sort struggles with sorting small stuff at the end 
of a list.
